# Continuous Integration/Deployment for Rails on Gitlab
![Gitlab piplines](/assets/images/pipline_green.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This blog post will explain to you how to setup Gitlab to run all your rails tests
and system tests and deploy everything to your staging app if everything is OK.

I will use Heroku to deploy my staging App.

# What we will achieve ?

## The build Stage

The build will contain:
- Installation of dependencies
- Database setup
- Precompile of assets (assets & webpacker)


## The Tests Stage

### The Integration tests

The stage will be responsible for running all integration tests, basically this
will run `bundle exec rails test`

### The system tests

The most exciting and important thing to have in my CI.
The system tests are very useful to test a complex UI requiring a massive use
of Javascript (React of Vue app) and interacting with external services like `Google
Map Places`.

The system test will do clicks and filling inputs like a regular user on your App.
The main command executed in this stage is `bundle exec rails test:system`.

The interesting side here is that we will use a docker to embed our `Selenium
Chrome browser` to run our browser.

## The deploy Stage
This is an easy step, it will be responsible for deploying the app in Heroku and
call the database migration.

-----------------------

# The GITLAB-CI

Gitlab offer to everyone ( and I am highly grateful to them) a way to define
how the code will be tested / deployed by creating a `.gitlab-ci` in the root of
your project hosted at gitlab.

This offer your a *centralized* and an *easy way* to manage your source code and
your continues integration for `FREE`.

## How this works

The CI follow these simple steps:
1. Booting one or several containers aka `services` that you have specified in the `.gitlab-ci`
2. Copy your repo the main container.
3. Run all scripts wanted in it

## Use the cache to speedup the CI
Gitlab allows you to cache folders and files and use them for the next jobs.
In our case, caching all the `gems` and `node_modules` will save us several minutes.

## Use artifacts to debug our tests
When a system tests fails, the test will save a `screenshots` in a temp folder.
The `artifacts` make possible for us to save those files and tie them to the
job.
This will help us a lot when we want to debug a failing system tests.


--------------------
# Let's do it

## 1. The build


### Prepare the build container

The build will be executed in a container, so we should have a container with
all the dependencies needed, for the modern rails app we should have:
- Ruby
- Node + Yarn
- Some system libraries

There is my `dockerfile`

```bash
FROM ruby:2.4.3

RUN curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
RUN echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
RUN apt-get update -qqy && apt-get install  -qqyy yarn nodejs postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev cmake

RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Easy yay !

Now, we should publish this container to use it.
`Gitlab` provide for us a container registry ! for free again !

So we just need to push this container in the project registry.

First, you should login to gitlab registry

```bash
docker login registry.gitlab.com
# use your gitlab credential
```

and PUSH

```bash
docker push registry.gitlab.com/[ORG]/[REPO]/[CONTAINER]:v1 # v1 is my version tag
```

If you have `ADSL` internet connection with a poor uploading speed, you can go
take a nap ;)

After the push terminates, you are good to go to the next step.

### The build script
This is the main script in the gitlab-ci file

```yaml
image: "registry.gitlab.com/[ORG]/[REPO]/[CONTAINER]:v1"

variables:
  LC_ALL: C.UTF-8
  LANG: en_US.UTF-8
  LANGUAGE: en_US.UTF-8
  RAILS_ENV: "test"
  POSTGRES_DB: test_db
  POSTGRES_USER: runner
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ""

# cache gems and node_modules for next usage
.default-cache: &default-cache
  cache:
    untracked: true
    key: my-project-key-5.2
    paths:
      - node_modules/
      - vendor/
      - public/

build:
  <<: *default-cache
  services:
    - postgres:latest
  stage: build
  script:
  - ruby -v
  - node -v
  - yarn --version
  - which ruby
  - gem install bundler  --no-ri --no-rdoc
  - bundle install  --jobs $(nproc) "${FLAGS[@]}" --path=vendor
  - yarn install
  - cp config/database.gitlab config/database.yml
  - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
  - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails assets:precompile
```

So I am using my image created before to instantiate a container and run my
build script inside.

I have added to my project a `config/database.gitlab` to replace the original
config and use the right host, username and password to connect to my database.

The database is mounted by the service config

```yaml
  services:
    - postgres:latest
```

Gitlab when reading this line will bootup a database container (postgress) and
will use the variables defined before to setup the database

```bash
  POSTGRES_DB: test_db
  POSTGRES_USER: runner
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ""
```

The `config/database.gitlab` will tell our rails app how to connect to the
database, so before the app boots, the `database.yml` will be replaced the
custom one.

```yaml
test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
  host: postgres
  username: runner
  password: ""
  database: test_db
```

## 2. The Integration Tests script
No need more explanation for this

```yaml
integration_test:
  <<: *default-cache
  stage: test
  services:
    - postgres:latest
    - redis:alpine
  script:
    - gem install bundler  --no-ri --no-rdoc
    - bundle install  --jobs $(nproc) "${FLAGS[@]}" --path=vendor
    - cp config/database.gitlab config/database.yml
    - bundle install --jobs $(nproc) "${FLAGS[@]}" --path=vendor
    - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
    - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails assets:precompile
    - bundle exec rake test

```

## 3. The System Tests script

The infrastructure to make possible the system test is quite interesting.

To run the test we should start a browser (in a container) and fetch the page from the puma
server (from an other container).

`The capybara` should be able to control the selenium driver.


![System tests & containers](/assets/images/system_tests.png){:class="img-responsive"}

```yaml
system_test:
  <<: *default-cache
  stage: test
  services:
    - postgres:latest
    - redis:alpine
    - selenium/standalone-chrome:latest
  script:
    - gem install bundler  --no-ri --no-rdoc
    - bundle install  --jobs $(nproc) "${FLAGS[@]}" --path=vendor
    - cp config/database.gitlab config/database.yml
    - export selenium_remote_url="http://selenium__standalone-chrome:4444/wd/hub/"
    - bundle install  --jobs $(nproc) "${FLAGS[@]}" --path=vendor
    - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
    - RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails assets:precompile
    - bundle exec rake test:system
  artifacts:
    when: on_failure
    paths:
      - tmp/screenshots/
```

We should tell to capybara to use the right `IP` instead of `localhost`, because here we have the browser
and the server in two different containers.

in the `environment/test.rb`, add these lines

```ruby
  net = Socket.ip_address_list.detect{|addr| addr.ipv4_private? }
  ip = net.nil? ? 'localhost' : net.ip_address
  config.domain = ip
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => config.domain }

  Capybara.server_port = 8200
  Capybara.server_host = ip
```

The `artifacts` is useful to see the scrennshots when your test fails

The `rails system test` will take screenshots and save them to `tmp/screenshots`

![System tests & scrennshots](/assets/images/screenshots.png){:class="img-responsive"}

As you can see, the screenshots are stored and attached to job, Neat!

## 4. Staging deployment

This will deploy our code if `build` and `tests` succeed.

```
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  variables:
    HEROKU_APP_NAME: YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME
  dependencies:
    - integration_test
    - system_test
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - gem install dpl
    - dpl --provider=heroku --app=$HEROKU_APP_NAME --api-key=$HEROKU_API_KEY
```

The `HEROKU_API_KEY` is stored in a safe place in the settings of the project

-------------
# Conclusion

`Gitlab` is an amazing project and provide a very nice spot where everything is well integrated to provide
us an very good coding experience.

I hope that the migration to `Google compute engine` will provide a better robustness to the project.

> Longue vie Ã  Gitlab !!
